# mushr_cad
This repo contains all CAD Files for MuSHR. Currently, all design files are written with OpenSCAD. Blender has also been used to synthesize individual parts into complete, colored models.

Note that all necessary parts for building the MuSHR Nano Racecar can be found in ./v3/stl/. All files in that directory should be printed exactly once, except racecar_cover_image should be printed twice. We recommend that racecar_cover_image and racecar_cover_number be printed in a different color than all of the other parts.

chassis: Design files for the chassis
images: Images that are used to make insets on the outer walls of the car
misc: Design files that are not specific to v2 or v3
v2: Design files for mushr-tx2
v3: Design files for mushr-nano
